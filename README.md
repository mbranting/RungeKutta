Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) for ODE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: 
Project that graphs the solutions for a dy/dx equation (1000+ values) given inital values -->
t0 = 0  //time
x0 = 1  //inital x value
y0 = 5  //inital y value
h = 0.02    //change in x

Files Included:
rungeK.py

How to run
Open python file on a platform able to run python code
Ensure the correct information is imported 
    ex. numpy, matplotlib
    //Should be contained at the beginning of the python file
Run program 

What is generated
1. The initial values are printed
2. The data values gathered through ODIENT are printed
3. Visual representation showing ( 1000 - 2000 points (x-values) )

IMPORTANT: Previous attempts to generate information from more of a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 
approach has been included but commented out
